              according to your liking. Don't worry if you don't like the item
              after you receive it, you can always consider the option for
              exchanging your item or even you can return your item and you will
              get the full amount back. Isn't that amazing? Start searching for
              your desired clothes and see it yourself. Once you are done with

              you can directly use your UPI ID to make the payment. We also

              amount at once. Other than that, you can directly make your
              payment through your bank details and even if you are not sure or
              you are in doubt then you can choose the Cash option where you can
              pay the amount in cash to our partner who will be delivering your
              cloth at your doorstep.
